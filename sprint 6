After completing the individual PowerPoint presentation detailing the parts of the project worked on, the focus now shifted to comprehensive testing. 
This includes verifying functionality post-login, such as secure authentication and proper redirection. Additionally, testing anchors within the user homepage ensures seamless navigation, 
confirming links to various sections and features work across different platforms. Once testing is finalized, the presentation will be ready for review, marking another milestone in the project's progress.
